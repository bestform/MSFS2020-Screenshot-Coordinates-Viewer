MSFS2020 Screenshot Coordinates Viewer
======================================

This is the companion app for [MSFS2020-Screenshot-Coordinates](https://github.com/bestform/MSFS2020-Screenshot-Coordinates)

To run it, just provide the executable with the Screenshot Directory using the `-d` parameter or by setting the env var `MSFS_SCREENSHOT_FOLDER`

It will serve an open street map on your localhost on port 8080 showing a marker on every screenshot location.
When you click on the marker, the corresponding screenshot will be opened.
